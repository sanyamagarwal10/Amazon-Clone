# Amazon Clone
This project is a simple Amazon Clone built using only HTML and CSS. It is a static website that mimics the user interface of Amazon, including the homepage, product pages, and shopping cart design. This project focuses on building layouts, styling elements, and creating a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
